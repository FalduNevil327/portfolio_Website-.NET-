                <h5>Welcome to my portfolio Website! I'm Thrilled to have you here.</h5>
                <p>
                    Hey, My Name is Nevil. I am a passionate computer engineering student currently pursuing my studies at Darshan University. My love for technology and its endless possibilities led me to choose this field, where I am constantly honing my skills and expanding my knowledge.Programming is not just a subject for me; it's a way of expressing my creativity and solving problems. Whether it's developing intuitive websites, crafting elegant app layouts, or designing brand logos, I find joy in every line of code I write.Beyond the digital realm, I have a diverse set of hobbies that fuel my creative spirit. Dancing allows me to express myself through movement and rhythm, while photography allows me to capture fleeting moments and tell stories through visuals. Graphic design is another avenue where I can channel my imagination and bring ideas to life.
